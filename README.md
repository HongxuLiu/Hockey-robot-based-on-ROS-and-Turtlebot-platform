#This the work repository for group3 of Leistungkurs C++#<br>
***
[FIXED]IF COMPILATION FAILED, PLEASE TRY AGAIN. IT CAN TAKE MAYBE 10 TRIES TO GET COMPILED DEPENDING ON YOUR LUCK. THIS IS BECAUSE THAT THE TURTLE_VIS PKG DEPENDS ON A .SO LIBRARY FILE WHICH MUST BE GENERATED FIRST. HOWEVER, THE COMPILE ORDER IS RANDOM... WE ARE WORKING ON A SOLUTION TO THIS. <br>
<br>
[FIXED]DUE TO UNFIXED DEPENDENCY PROBLEMS, THE MAIN_STATE_MACHINE PACKAGE MUST BE CATKIN_MADE FIRST. WAIT TO BE FIXED.<br>

The launcher.launch file in main_state_machine package launches all nodes.

If there is anything not working, do git reset --hard 5824eae7 to reset the repository back to the competition version, or 1472c0e7, the problematical last-sec "final" version.<br>

The group members are:<br>
1.Han, Fengze<br>
2.Qu, Xingwei<br>
3.Wang, Daoping<br>
4.Wu, Yingyu<br>
5.Dong, Chao<br>

The best teamwork~
